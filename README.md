# Marix_based_parity_method_for_error_and_detection
## Setup Instructions
## Generate Test Files:
Run creating_file.py to create the necessary four test files.

## Image Processing:
Run easy_spot_error_all_3_bits.py and provide the image path. After that give the value of p where p is the size of matrix (p*p) matrix. This script generates a binary file of the image and performs error detection and correction.

## Additional Scripts:
Run CAN.py, energy.py, plot1.py, and memory.py for getting the time comparison , energy comparison and the RAM graph.

## Libraries Used

- **Image Processing**: `pillow`  
- **System Monitoring**: `psutil`, `tracemalloc`  
- **Plotting**: `matplotlib`  
- **Utilities**: `time`
